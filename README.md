In order for mpq.vbs to run correctly you have to have the sound .wav plugins which is sound 5 and sound 8.
It shows a flashing page for 70 seconds with the sound effects. It give 2 warnings to people with senitive vision.
This is a UPDATED 2.0 version with the cancel button proporly working.
Download the new sourse code for it to build!
If you download the VBS only there's no sound and you have to manually stop it from running this was my first version of mpq.vbs before it became more complex.
